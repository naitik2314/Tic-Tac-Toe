## Description

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a structured and organized codebase. 
The graphical user interface is built using the Turtle graphics library, allowing players to take turns and compete against each other. 
The game keeps track of the score and declares a winner when one player reaches the specified score limit.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach for a structured codebase.
- A graphical user interface built with Turtle graphics.
- Two players can take turns to play the game.
- Keeps track of each player's score.
- Declares a winner when one player reaches the specified score limit.
- Option to set the maximum score limit and player names.
- Visual indicators for game status, including ties and winner declarations.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naitik2314/tic-tac-toe.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py #For Linux/Mac
   python main.py #For Windows

4. Enter the maximum score limit and player names when prompted.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty square.
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols wins the round.
- The game keeps track of the score, and the first player to reach the specified score limit wins the match.
- If all squares are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.
